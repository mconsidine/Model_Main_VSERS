 # - range_ea:         all possible entry ages  
 # - range_age:        range of age
 # - nyear:            number of years in simulation
 # - wf_growth:        growth rate of the size of workforce
 # - no_entrance:      no new entrants into the workforce if set "TRUE". Overrides "wf_growth"
 # - Decrement table:  from Model_Decrements.R  
 # - Initial workforce for each type:
 #    - init_pop$actives:   matrix, max ea by max age
 #    - init_pop$retirees:  matrix, max ea by max age


## An array is created for each of the 6 status:
 #  (1)Active     (dim = 3)
 #  (2)Terminated (dim = 4)
 #  (3)Retired    (dim = 4)
 #  (4)Disabled   (dim = 3) later will be expanded to dim = 4, with additional dim being year.disb
 #  (5)Dead       (dim = 3) We do not really need an array for dead, what's needed is only the total number of dead.

# The time line used in this model assume retirement occurs at the beginning of every period. In other words the 
# switch of retirement status happens at the beginning of each period. However, the transition process here requires that
# any switch of status between t - 1(beginning) and t(beginning) must be defined in period t - 1. Hence we need to make following 
# adjustment to the decrement table:
  # Move qxr.a backward by 1 period.(qxr at t is now assigned to t - 1), the probability of retirement at t - 1 is lead(qxr.a(t))*(1 - qxt.a(t-1) - qxm.a(t-1) - qxd.a(t-1))
  # For the age right before the max retirement age (r.max - 1), probability of retirement is 1 - qxm.a - qxd.a - qxt.a,
    # which means all active members who survive all other risks at (r.max - 1) will enter the status "retired" for sure at age r.max (and collect the benefit regardless 
    # whether they will die at r.max)
